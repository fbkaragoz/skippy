# Skippy

**An AI companion experiment that learns, listens, and lives across your platforms.**

## What is Skippy?

Skippy is my ongoing experiment to build a personal AI companion — one that learns from how I interact online, responds intelligently, and feels more like a friend than a tool.

We all love him, we all need him.

If you’ve played *Cyberpunk 2077*, you’ll remember Skippy — the quirky AI-powered gun with more personality than most humans. That idea of a sentient, witty digital companion stuck with me. This project borrows that same spirit: an AI that listens, talks, and evolves alongside you.

## How It Started

I first built Skippy — under a different name — back in **2023**, using the **OpenAI API**.  
My original goal was simple: to create a smart assistant that could follow me across the vast ocean of the Internet.

Through **multi-platform API synchronization** — integrating **Discord**, **YouTube**, and other services — I wanted Skippy to see what I was doing, watching, or talking about, so he could respond meaningfully, suggest ideas, or simply know me better.

Back then, my programming skills were still developing, so the first version never quite reached the level I envisioned.  
Since then, I’ve kept learning — diving deep into **NLP**, **machine learning**, and building more complex, agentic systems.

## Why It Matters

Applied AI keeps accelerating faster than ever.  
Projects like Skippy represent something deeply personal to me — a human-centered experiment in synchronous, multi-platform intelligence.

I know there are now countless AI assistant projects out there.  
But Skippy was one of the earliest attempts at a **synchronous agentic LLM** — and I want to preserve, document, and refine it properly.  
Not as an industry-changing innovation, but as a passionate, evolving idea.

## Vision

I’m not trying to build the next big tech product.  
All I want is to make **Skippy unskippable** — a companion that truly listens, grows, and feels alive.

Follow along as Skippy learns to talk smarter, think deeper, and maybe even surprise us someday.
